## Configuration

### appsettings.json

#### LogicMonitor credentials

To complete this, you will need to [create a LogicMonitor API Token](https://www.logicmonitor.com/support/settings/users-and-roles/api-tokens).

Configure your logicMonitor credentials as follows:
* Account: this is the first part of your LogicMonitor URL. For example, 'acme' in https://acme.logicmonitor.com/.
* AccessId: Add 
* AccessKey: Add (you will be unable to view this in LogicMonitor once the API token has been saved)

#### Variables
These are tokens that can be repeated later on in your configuration.  Optional.

#### Repetition
The entire configuration can be applied multiple times.
* Type 'None': No repetition. 
* Type 'Xlsx': Repeat the config for each row in the sheet specified in Config.
* Config: for Xlsx repetition type, set this to &lt;import file path&gt;|&lt;sheet name&gt;  The config will be applied to all rows in the single talbe on that sheet.

### data.xlsx

This file should contain multiple sheets:
* One for repetition (if repetition type Xlsx is used)
	* a sheet with a single table with two rows: one for customer 1, one for customer 2
* One per list that you wish to manage, for example:
  * one sheet with a single table containing all subnets for customer 1
  * another sheet with a single table containing all subnets for customer 2

## Running

When running, by default the system will look for the appsettings.json file.
If you want to force a mode, you can do this in the appsettings.json file, though we recommend that you start in "Menu" mode, as configured in appsettings.example.json.
From menu mode, you can choose to "C"reate or "D"elete the configuration specified in your appsettings.json file.
Press Ctrl+C to exit the application.
